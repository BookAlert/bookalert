# Overview

Most of us share a love of books, whether an occasional or avid reader. It's not always easy to keep up with new releases,
especially if you have many favorite authors.  Searching the internet by individual author to check for new and upcoming releases can be 
tedious, and time consuming.

This is why we created BookAlert. 

We wanted to make a web application that provides an easy way to solve this problem.  BookAlert is a full stack web application, that 
provides an easy way to stay up to date on new, and upcoming releases from your favorite authors, and offers some other useful features.
